    # unbounce units now at 2 vs 1


    # needs some sort of dfs to work out end of trees
    # i.e. which locations can be resolved easily

    # or 

    # do the ones that can be resolved instantly
    # keep going until all are done (iterative)
    # remove from dict as you go?


    # the ones that can be resolved instantly are ones that don't depend on outside sources
    

    # orrr we do a first pass, only looking at indiviual tiles?
